# template-sveltekit-package

You probably don't need this template and should just run `npx sv create`.

This is a [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) package project which I use as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template):

## Keeping dependencies up-to-date

I update dependencies in this template regularly. Run `npx sv create` to regenerate a
SvelteKit packageproject into the existing directory.

### Where would you like your project to be created?

Hit enter to use the current directory.

### Directory not empty. Continue?

Yes.

### Which template would you like?

Svelte library.

### Add type checking with TypeScript?

Yes, using TypeScript syntax.

### What would you like to add to your project?

- `prettier`
- `eslint`
- `vitest`

### Wrap it up

- Revert `README.md`.
- Delete folder `node_modules` and file `pnpm-lock.yaml` and run `pnpm i`.

## Debugging

Just launch the application in the
[JavaScript Debug Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-javascript-debug-terminal).
